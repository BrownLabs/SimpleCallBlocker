# SimpleCallBlocker
A simple call blocker for Android devices that does not have ads and never sends data to remote services

# Overview
This is a simple call blocker for phone calls (not SMS) from phone numbers not in your contact list.  There are no other options other than enabled or disabled.  Disable the blocker if you are expecting a call from a number not in your contact list.  This app works on Andorid 9.0+ (Pie) when most other call blockers have stopped working.

This app does not share your contact list, or any other data, with any remote service and there is no advertising.

The app will check calls whether the UI is running or not.  That is unless you &quot;force stop&quot; the app.  In that case, you'll need to open the Simple Call Blocker app to restart the call checking function.

Enjoy.
